# simulation-set
This is the test set we used in the paper “IMPROVING LOW-COMPLEXITY AND REAL-TIME DEEPFILTERNET2 FOR
PERSONALIZED SPEECH ENHANCEMENT”,termed simulation-set, which can be found in https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1yrye3yejh6Hnmn_g4JPxXXAkFsbyY3a8?usp=sharing. The three folders contain noisy speech,clean speech and enrollment speech respectively,and the corresponding relationship between them are recorded in the SCP files. And we provide several noisy and enhanced samples for listening.
